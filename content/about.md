My name is Manuel Sánchez, I´m **Senior Technical Manager & Azure Evangelist at [NTT Data](https://nttdata.com/)** & **Microsoft Azure MVP**.
Passionate about new technologies, highlighting Microsoft Azure, IA, Bots and .NET, Xamarin. Passionate about team management. I contribute to the developers community writing articles in my personal blog and giving speeches in numerous events. I am also one of the **[Netcoreconf](https://netcoreconf.com/)** & **[CATzure](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/CATzure/)** leads.


These are some of the events that I also participate in and organize with other colleagues from the community:

* Global Azure 
* Global AI Bootcamp
* Global DevOps Bootcamp
* Global Integration Bootcamp
* Azure Day
* Azure Summer of Experts

I love being able to talk about technology and share my knowledge with the rest of the community. Some of my hobbies are basketball, running, playing the guitar and of course beer!
